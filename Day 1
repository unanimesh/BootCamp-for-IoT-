Basics  of C programming  for IoT.

First Part (The Header File);
   
  #include<stdio.h>

Second Part (where our actual code goes)
    
  int main()
            {
              our actual code goes there.
            }

Third Part (the int keyword indicate that the function main will return an integer)

  return 0;

We can always end the line with a semicolon;
Such that the compilers knows that the new statement is started.
